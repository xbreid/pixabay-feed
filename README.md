## ‚öôÔ∏è Front-End Architecture
<a name="front-end"/>

### Built on Vite

Since this project was spun up using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), it's purely a client side rendered single page React application. Uses the power of esbuild over webpack for faster build times.

### Styles

Styles in this project are written in SASS using SCSS syntax. Implementation is handled by node-sass, and esbuild. BEM styling model was used.

### Animations/Transitions

All Animations and transitions are done through react-pose and pure SCSS.

### Design

I followed I very minimalist design approach. The site was styled mobile first, meaning media queries are done for tablet, desktop.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Back-End Architecture
<a name="back-end"/>

### Ruby on Rails

This project uses a decoupled Rails API backend. Acting as a middleware microservice for managing queries to Pixabay.

### Security/API Auth

Currently the project is using JWTs to authorize users and provides a valid 48 hours token.

Due to time constraints, this projects doesn't have much set up for an optimized production environment. Currently the site is hosted using Vite's Preview functionality which is not meant for a scalable production environment.

### Testing

Unit Testing to come soon hopefully, but right now no unit tests have been created.
